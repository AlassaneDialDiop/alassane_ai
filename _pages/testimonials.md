    # AI-generated recommendations for a gourmet guide

    **Context**

    Elevating a culinary platform with AI-generated recommendations  
    I collaborated with Tastet, a local gourmet guide focusing on equity, diversity, and personalization.  
    Together, we worked on creating an innovative approach to culinary exploration.

    **Outcome**

    In our collaboration, we designed a comprehensive tech stack, orchestrating a seamless end-to-end pipeline for AI-driven recommendations. From data collection in a Google Storage bucket to a Docker container hosting a real-time recommendation API, every step was meticulously crafted for optimal performance.

    During my M.Sc. Data Science at HEC Montreal, I was selected for an internship with the startup Tastet.ca.  
    It was the start of an exciting journey that led us to sponsorships from the [Mitacs](https://www.mitacs.ca/) and supervising from HEC professor [Laurent Charlin](https://www.hec.ca/profs/laurent.charlin.html).

    This experience was later enriched with a consultant role for the company, acting as the AI expert for them.
