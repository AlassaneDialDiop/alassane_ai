## Client Success Stories

### AI-Generated Recommendations for Tastet.ca

#### Context
I collaborated with Tastet, a local gourmet guide focusing on equity, diversity, and personalization. Together, we worked on creating an innovative approach to culinary exploration.

#### The Journey
During my M.Sc. Data Science at HEC Montreal, I was selected for an internship with the startup Tastet.ca. It was the start of an exciting journey that led us to sponsorships from [Mitacs](https://www.mitacs.ca/) and supervision from HEC Professor [Laurent Charlin](https://www.hec.ca/profs/laurent.charlin.html).

This experience was later enriched with a consultant role for the company, acting as the AI expert for them.

#### Outcome
In our collaboration, we designed a comprehensive tech stack, orchestrating a seamless end-to-end pipeline for AI-driven recommendations. From data collection in a Google Storage bucket to a Docker container hosting a real-time recommendation API, every step was meticulously crafted for optimal performance.
