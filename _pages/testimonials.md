    <h1>AI-generated recommendations for a gourmet guide</h1>

    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>

    <p>Elevating a culinary platform with AI-generated recommendations<br>
    I collaborated with Tastet, a local gourmet guide focusing on equity, diversity, and personalization.<br>
    Together, we worked on creating an innovative approach to culinary exploration.</p>

    <p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>

    <p>In our collaboration, we designed a comprehensive tech stack, orchestrating a seamless end-to-end pipeline for AI-driven recommendations. From data collection in a Google Storage bucket to a Docker container hosting a real-time recommendation API, every step was meticulously crafted for optimal performance.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>During my M.Sc. Data Science at HEC Montreal, I was selected for an internship with the startup Tastet.ca.<br>
    It was the start of an exciting journey that led us to sponsorships from the <a href="https://www.mitacs.ca/">Mitacs</a> and supervising from HEC professor <a href="https://www.hec.ca/profs/laurent.charlin.html">Laurent Charlin</a>.</p>

    <p>This experience was later enriched with a consultant role for the company, acting as the AI expert for them.</p>
