## Project Overview

Built a sophisticated product recommendation engine for a major e-commerce platform, processing millions of user interactions daily to deliver personalized product suggestions. The system combines multiple recommendation strategies to maximize relevance and conversion rates.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Strategy Recommendation System
- **Collaborative Filtering**: User behavior pattern analysis
- **Content-Based**: Product attribute similarity matching
- **Session-Based**: Real-time browsing pattern recognition
- **Cross-Selling**: Complementary product suggestions
- **Trending**: Time-sensitive popularity algorithms

### 2. Real-Time Personalization
- Sub-50ms response time for recommendations
- Dynamic re-ranking based on user actions
- Context-aware suggestions (device, time, location)
- Instant inventory synchronization

### 3. Advanced Analytics
- User segmentation and cohort analysis
- A/B testing framework for algorithm optimization
- Revenue attribution tracking
- Predictive lifetime value modeling

## Technical Architecture
