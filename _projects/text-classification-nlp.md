## Project Overview

Developed an advanced text classification system using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing techniques, specifically leveraging fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models to achieve high-accuracy text categorization across multiple domains.

TextClassifierGPT allows you classify texts using your file and your classification system— additionally provide a few examples for better results.
